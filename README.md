# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains my implementation of a sudoku solver using Python. The visualization of the backtracking algorithm can be seen in the terminal.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/miles-lenz/sudoku-solver.git
```

## Usage

1. Create an `sudoku.txt` file in the root directory. Fill in the sudoku you want to be solved. See or use the `sudoku_example.txt` file for reference on how to format your sudoku.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. A visualization of the algorithm will be display in the terminal. The solution will be saved in the `solution.txt` file.
